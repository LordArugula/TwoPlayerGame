## Requirements

Design the user interface and implement the functionality for a game app of your choice. The app should keep track of the game statistics such as player names, avatars (optional), wins, losses, and number of times played. You may optionally store other data that is collected in your game. You can design the features, UI and controls in your own creative way. It can be simple or complex depending on your design.

You select the theme. You can design a card game, mystery, action, learning or any type of game that you wish. Think about a game idea that you can create for an interesting app that you might want to create for yourself in the future. You may select to build the main UI in this assignment and then build the standard or custom animation in the next assignment which is assignment 6. Your next assignment (#6) can build from the functionality that you are designing in this assignment. You might want to preview the requirements for assignment 6 so that you can build that version from this one.
