## Part 2: Requirements

Design the user interface and implement the functionality for an app of your choice that uses standard or custom Android animations. You decide on the theme and functionality of this app design. You can design the theme, features, UI and controls in your own creative way. It can be simple or complex depending on your design.

You may select to re-design one of your previous assignments to include an animation feature of your choice. This way you are not starting fresh, rather you are building on a design that you have already created to include some sort of animation of your choice. Only one form of animation is required but more can be added. You may wish to add animations to the game that you designed in assignment 5. Most games can use some sort of animation to make it more exciting for the user.

## Submission

Added an animation for the intro when starting the gameplay. Text slides in and out of the screen that says "Ready" and "Go!". After the game ends when the players win or lose, the title animates onto the screen.

## Requirements

Design the user interface and implement the functionality for a game app of your choice. The app should keep track of the game statistics such as player names, avatars (optional), wins, losses, and number of times played. You may optionally store other data that is collected in your game. You can design the features, UI and controls in your own creative way. It can be simple or complex depending on your design.

You select the theme. You can design a card game, mystery, action, learning or any type of game that you wish. Think about a game idea that you can create for an interesting app that you might want to create for yourself in the future. You may select to build the main UI in this assignment and then build the standard or custom animation in the next assignment which is assignment 6. Your next assignment (#6) can build from the functionality that you are designing in this assignment. You might want to preview the requirements for assignment 6 so that you can build that version from this one.
